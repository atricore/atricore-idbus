        Specifies a CacheManagerEventListenerFactory  which will be used to create a CacheManagerPeerProvider, which
        is notified when Caches are added or removed from the CacheManager.

        The attributes of CacheManagerEventListenerFactory are:
        - class - a fully qualified factory class name
        - properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

        Sets the fully qualified class name to be registered as the CacheManager event listener.

    The events include:
    - adding a Cache
    - removing a Cache

    Callbacks to listener methods are synchronous and unsynchronized. It is the responsibility of the implementer
    to safely handle the potential performance and thread safety issues depending on what their listener is doing.

    If no class is specified, no listener is created. There is no default.

    <!--Default Cache configuration. These will applied to caches programmatically created through
    the CacheManager.

    The following attributes are required:

    maxElementsInMemory            - Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory
    eternal                        - Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
                                     element is never expired.
    overflowToDisk                 - Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the in-memory cache
                                     has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes are optional:
    timeToIdleSeconds              - Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
                                     i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
                                     Is only used if the element is not eternal.
                                     Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
                                     The default value is 0.
    timeToLiveSeconds              - Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
                                     i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
                                     Is only used if the element is not eternal.
                                     Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
                                     The default value is 0.
    diskPersistent                 - Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
                                     The default value is false.
    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds- The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
                                     is 120 seconds.
    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy      - Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
                                     policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
                                     First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
                                     (specified as LFU)
    cacheEventListenerClassNames   - A comma separated list of CacheEventListeners. The fully qualified class name of

                                     Registered listeners will be notified of cache events such as Element puts, removes and expiries
                                     and Cache status changes. The default if unspecified is an empty notifications list
