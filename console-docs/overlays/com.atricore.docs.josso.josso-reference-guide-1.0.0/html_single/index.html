        JOSSO is an open source Internet SSO solution for rapid and standards-based Internet-scale Single Sign-On
        implementations, allowing secure Internet access to the Web-based applications or services of customers,
        suppliers, and business partners.
    </p><p>
        With Single Sign-On (SSO), access to multiple applications and services that are related
        (yet independent of one another) can be achieved without requiring multiple authentications by the user.
        By logging in just once, the user gains access to all the applications - saving time and avoiding the
        inconvenience of logging in to each separately.
    </p><p>
        JOSSO accomplishes this with ease. In most cases, deploying an SSO solution means investing some pretty
        significant resources for SSO-enabling business applications and the set-up of authoritative sources of
        identity data. With JOSSO things are different. Through its agent architecture, JOSSO enables these
        capabilities transparently, making integration so simple it's practically non-existent.
        In most cases, it won't even require an application build.
    </p><p>
        And third-party applications – whose source code might not be available – can be SSO-enabled just as if they
        were in-house applications.
    </p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Point_And_Click_SSO"/>1.1. Enter Point-and-Click Internet Single Sign On (SSO)</h2></div></div></div><p>
            Identity and Access Management is widely considered to be a highly technical domain, with an implementation
            that's out of reach for most folks. The process of setting up a system for identity and access management
            has a well-earned reputation for technical difficulty, inconvenience, and errors; all in pursuit of an end product
            that most users dislike and avoid.
        </p><p>
            Unless you're a Subject Matter Expert (SME) or a technical architect, you're going to have some trouble
            setting up a process that will then be really difficult to use.
        </p><p>
            Commercial identity and access management packages offer web-based facilities to set up their products;
            but without an intimate knowledge of the product's inner structure, the overall set up and roll-out
            experience is tedious and error-prone.
        </p><p>
            JOSSO incorporates the Atricore Console Rich Internet Application (RIA) for enabling ease of use, which
            translates to productivity. Technically savvy people can get on board with your identity solutions,
            significantly accelerating time-to-value for enabling federated identity settings.
        </p><p>
            Simply "draw" your Internet SSO setting, and bring it to life in a snap. Work at the architecture level.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="First_or_Second_Generation"/>1.2. First or Second Generation ?</h2></div></div></div><p>
            JOSSO1 represents the first generation of the JOSSO product line. It's a mature and stable SSO solution for
            transparent Single Sign-on, targeted to introduce web SSO capabilities onto web
            containers hosting the SSO-enabled web applications.
            The transparency capability is mainly achieved by having JOSSO comply with security contract standards,
            such as the ones offered by the JavaEE platform. The main benefit of transparency is
            that the applications relying on the the underlying platform's security contracts can be SSO-enabled without
            any integration effort at all, and without being forced to couple with the SSO stack.
        </p><p>
            The wide support for application vendors makes it a compelling option for bringing on board applications
            built on heterogeneous platforms.
        </p><p>
            Moreover, the product is highly extensible, offering a simple component model for implementing plug-ins
            intended to introduce business-specific variability within the identity management layer.
        </p><p>
            One of the major limitations of JOSSO1 is that it doesn't "play nice" with third-party SSO solutions,
            potentially hosted in external security domains. For instance, there is no out of the box support for
            passing on the security context to an SaaS
            provider. Setting up an internet-scale SSO based on JOSSO1 would force all
            the involved entities to use JOSSO1.
        </p><p>
            In terms of usability, setting up the product requires the involvement of technically-savvy personnel,
            capable of dealing with configuration descriptors and with a good working knowledge of both the SSO pieces
            and the underlying infrastructure.
        </p><p>
            JOSSO1 is highly extensible in terms of the wide support provided for mainstream application
            platforms, authentication mechanisms and identity stores, but the SSO protocol is hardwired onto the
            product. Therefore, providing full compatibility with other protocols and their bindings - such as the
            commonly known SAML or OpenID - is not possible.
        </p><p>
            Another limitation is that JOSSO1 is not oriented to work in a multi-tenant environment. Limited support is
            provided for this feature through the definition of security domains.
        </p><p>
            Finally, JOSSO1 is targeted for SSO only, thus leaving account and entitlement management and storage to
            third-party software components. As a result, more effort and
            investment are usually involved in order to cope with the missing pieces.
        </p><p>
            JOSSO2 is the second generation of the JOSSO product line. This generation is an all-in-one solution that
            enables end-to-end delivery of Internet/Federated Single Sign-On settings, building on a purely model-driven
            approach for lowering the entry barrier and shortening time-to-value. It's also bundled with account and
            entitlement management support, building on an RDBMS-based internal identity store. Many other building
            blocks, which are provided by the Atricore Identity Bus kernel, enable JOSSO2 to expand its coverage to
            other areas of identity and access management which haven't been addressed in the past.
        </p><p>
            If you have a rather standard and controlled setting, and you're looking to implement it in an
            out-of-the-box fashion,
             with little involvement from IT, JOSSO2 might be the right choice for you.
            JOSSO2 can significantly help by delivering an Internet-scale SSO solution, thus involving
            external/cloud-based partner sites (e.g. suppliers, remote branches, etc.) and potentially hosting their
            internal identity back-end.
        </p><p>
            You might consider using JOSSO1 for solving simpler SSO scenarios scoped to a single administrative unit,
            with little or no requirements in terms of interoperability with external entities
            (e.g. partners, suppliers, branches, etc.) where trust relationship among these is weak. Since no account
            and
            entitlement management is provided, a business-specific application would need to be built.
        </p><p>
            Alternatively, whereas a third-party generic tooling could be leveraged for this (like an LDAP console),
            it will provide a view only at the specific storage technology abstraction level, thus significantly
            affecting
            usability and information consistency, as well as increasing the entry barrier for administrators.
        </p><p>
            In addition, you'll find more free support from the large community of adopters that the
            project has won during its six years of life.
        </p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="JOSSO2_Rollout"/>Chapter 2. JOSSO2 Rollout</h2></div></div></div><p>
        </p><p>
            The first step is to download the JOSSO2 distribution from this location:
            http://sourceforge.net/projects/josso/files/JOSSO%202/
        </p><p>

        </p><p>
            Expand the file into a directory of your choice. This directory will be the JOSSO2 home directory, which
            we will refer to as JOSSO2_HOME.
        </p><p>
        </p><p>
            Change to the "bin" directory within JOSSO2_HOME, and execute the "atricore" command.
            This will bootstrap JOSSO2 and the built-in identity appliances, which offer the essential provisioning
            interfaces upon which the Atricore Console depends. This process can take several minutes depending on
            the processing capabilities of the host equipment.
        </p><p>
        </p><p>
            All bundles need to be up and running before using the product, so make sure that they all show an
            initialization state of "Active". Through the command line console, you can monitor the execution status of
            all the modules that make up the product. The following command can be used to determine that all JOSSO
            modules are up and running :
        </p><p>

        </p><pre class="screen">
            osgi:list | grep Atricore
        </pre><p>

        </p><p>
            Make sure that all listed bundles are in the "Active" state.
        </p><p>
        </p><p>
            If startup fails, use the log file located within the JOSSO2_HOME/data/logs directory to diagnose the reason
            for the failure.
        </p><p>

        </p><p>
            From the Atricore Console, you can specify your digital identity architecture at a birds-eye view level,
            while still retaining the ability to "drill down" on any single component. Atricore Console also makes it
            possible for you to seamlessly mix and match the building blocks of your Internet SSO setting, realizing
            both SAML-compliant Identity Provider and Service Provider roles. These can then be connected to any number
            of identity sources, automatically provisioning SSO capabilities onto the web container or application
            server of your choice.
        </p><p>

        </p><p>
            Now you're ready to run the Atricore Console. In order to launch it, hit the following URL:
            http://josso2host:8081/atricore-console and sign in using the default credentials:'admin' as the username
            and 'admin' as the password.
        </p><p>

            JOSSO builds on the Atricore Identity Bus. It is distributed as stand-alone software within which
            your specific Identity and Access Management solutions can be specified and implemented.
            As opposed to an end-solution, JOSSO is an infrastructure on top of which solutions can be implemented. In
            some sense, JOSSO acts as an application server specifically targeted for realizing Internet Single Sign-On
            (SSO) scenarios.

                OSGi (the Open Services Gateway Initiative) is many things to many people. A full discussion
                of the history of, viewpoints on, and capabilities of OSGi is beyond the scope of this book and would
                likely fill an entire volume on its own. We encourage readers who are interested in OSGi's origins and
                rationale to consult http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi and http://www.osgi.org/Main/HomePage.
                As of November 2010, JOSSO uses version 4.1 of the OSGi standard, also known as JSR-291 within
                the Java Community Process.
            </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Identity_Appliances"/>3.1.2. Identity Appliances</h3></div></div></div><p>
                Internet SSO solutions are known within JOSSO as "Identity Appliances". An Identity Appliance is an
                artifact which holds the definitions necessary to instantiate Internet SSO services, in order to realize
                a specific identity architecture.
            </p><p>
                For instance, upon deployment of an identity appliance, defined Internet SSO endpoints are enabled.
                Each endpoint will expose a specific behavior, such as for a specific authentication service, or
                identity data streams from an arbitrary identity store responding to a specific user schema.
            </p><p>
                Identity Appliances can be specified either by using a visual notation (using the Atricore Console) or
                directly, using a textual notation based on XML descriptors .
            </p><p>
                Identity Appliances are standard OSGi Bundles, as are all the artifacts that make up JOSSO. A bundle is
                a single file containing all the information about a given component; this single file is in "jar"
                format, nearly identical to the "jar archives" that Java developers use to distribute libraries of code.
                The bundle is composed of a MANIFEST.MF file which specifies its identity and the bundles upon which it
                depends, as well as what is visible for other bundles to use.
            </p><p>
                Descriptors are based on Spring Dynamic Modules for OSGi Service Platforms.
                The Spring Dynamic Modules for OSGi(tm) Service Platforms projects make it easy to build Spring
                applications that run in an OSGi framework. A Spring application written in this way provides better
                separation of modules with the ability to dynamically add, remove, and update modules in a running
                system, the ability to deploy multiple versions of a module simultaneously (and allow clients to
                automatically bind to the appropriate one), and a dynamic service model. For more detailed information
                consult http://www.springsource.org/osgi.
            </p><p>
                Apache Maven is the recommended build system for packaging an identity appliance, though any build
                system can be used.
                Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project
                object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of
                information.
            </p><p>
                In addition, identity appliances generated through the Atricore Console include a build descriptor - namely
                pom.xml - for packaging the identity appliance in an out-of-the-box fashion through Apache Maven 3.
                Additionally, the layout used internally by JOSSO to reference identity appliances is the one used by
                Apache Maven.
            </p><p>
                A Maven repository is a collection of project artifacts stored in a directory structure that closely
                matches a project's Maven coordinates. You can see this structure by opening up a Web browser and
                browsing the central Maven repository at http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/.
                You will see that an artifact with the coordinates org.apache.commons:commons-email:1.1 is available
                under the directory /org/apache/commons/commons-email/1.1/ in a file named commons-email-1.1.jar.
                The standard for a Maven repository is to store an artifact in the following directory relative to the
                root of the repository:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
                
        /&lt;groupId&gt;/&lt;artifactId&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;artifactId&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.
        &lt;packaging&gt;
        &lt;/programlisting&gt;
    
            </pre><p>
                Maven downloads artifacts and plugins from a remote repository to your local machine and stores these
                artifacts in your local Maven repository. Once Maven has downloaded an artifact from the remote
                Maven repository, it never needs to download that artifact again. Maven will always look for the
                artifact in the local repository before looking elsewhere.
            </p><p>
                JOSSO hosts two internal Maven Repositories which are accessed each time an OSGi bundle needs to be
                installed.
            </p><p>
                The first repository, located under ${JOSSO_HOME}/system, contains the executable artifacts that make up the
                JOSSO distribution. Both JOSSO-specific artifacts and their dependencies can be found here.
            </p><p>
                The second repository, located under ${JOSSO_HOME}/appliances, contains identity appliances which are OSGi
                bundles as well. Identity appliances represent the deployment-specific artifacts, building on the
                JOSSO ones. Every time an identity appliance is generated and packaged using the lifecycle management
                facilities provided with the Atricore Console, it is dropped into this location.
            </p><p>
                Once dropped into the ${JOSSO_HOME}/appliances repository, the appliance can be referenced whenever a deployment action
                is requested for a specific identity appliance. Once deployed, its lifecycle can be managed the same as any other
                OSGi bundle.
            </p><p>
                Feature descriptors are used in order to simplify the provisioning of capabilities within JOSSO.
                These provide a simple yet flexible way to provision applications, or "features". Such a mechanism
                is mainly provided by a set of commands available in the features shell.
                JOSSO features are stored in the ${JOSSO_HOME}/features folder which complies with the Maven repository
                layout.
            </p><p>
                For instance, the main features descriptor for the JOSSO2 distribution looks like this :

                As you might notice, a feature encompasses one or more bundles whose coordinates follow the Maven
                repository model. On the other hand, features can depend on other features. For instance, the upper
                descriptor shows that JOSSO depends on Atricore Identity Bus-specific features which encompass
                Atricore Identity Bus OSGi bundles.

            This section covers the building blocks of JOSSO2. Federated SSO usage scenarios are implemented by
            mixing and matching those building blocks in identity appliance models, using a purely visual approach.
        </p><p>
            The following is a high-level overview which introduces element semantics without covering the precise usage
            details of every element.
            Those usage details are covered in the 'Setup' section.
        </p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Providers"/>3.2.1. Providers</h3></div></div></div><p>
                Providers can be categorized as either a Service Provider (SP) or and Identity Provider (IdP).
                An SP role is played by a system entity, when the system entity provides services to
                principals
                or other system entities.
                An IdP is a type of SP that creates, maintains, and manages identity
                information
                for principals, and provides principal authentication to other SPs within a federation.
                In a nutshell, an IdP provides authentication for a user, while a
                Service
                Provider relies on an IdP to authorize it, and establishes a security
                context.


                An IdP element is represented with this figure :

                TODO: insert IdP figure

                An SP element is represented in the figure below :

                TODO: insert SP figure

                An IdP can be connected with an SP through a Federated Identity connection.
                This establishes a trust relationship between the IdP and the SP, which implies that
                the latter is willing to rely on the claims about a principal established by the former. The common
                trust system
                for SSO exchanges is based on digital signature, which ensures message integrity, authentication
                and non-repudiation.

                An IdP can be associated with an Identity Source through an identity lookup connection.
                This makes the IdP point to a specific identity store for consuming user and entitlement
                information.
                Such information is then leveraged for backing authentication processes and obtaining claim entries for
                populating security tokens.

                A Service Provider, as mentioned earlier, can be connected with one or more IdPs through a
                Federated
                Identity Connection, meaning that the SP will rely upon the claims presented by the
                trusted IdP.
            </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Identity_Sources"/>3.2.2. Identity Sources</h3></div></div></div><p>
                Identity Sources represent the data layer of providers. Identity and access management processes require
                such a layer in order to back authentication and related processes such as SSO. For instance, Identity
                Providers
                use
                the information provided by identity sources for retrieving the user entry that will be used to carry out
                the
                authentication process, and extract the claims that will populate a security token. SPs
                also
                rely on a data layer. Common usage scenarios for this process include augmenting IdP-facing claims with
                additional
                claims, or supporting the local authentication of principals.

                Identity Sources have three main distinctive characteristics which determine their nature: storage
                mechanism, user schema and access protocol.

                The storage mechanism determines the technological support and information model - such as the
                relational or
                hierarchical - which will be used to persist user information. A commonly used storage mechanism is the
                directory, which relies on a hierarchical information model.

                The user schema determines how user entries are structured: how user attributes are going to be
                referenced,
                and how the semantics for these will be placed. This represents the data contract with which consumers need to comply
                in
                order
                to be allowed to access user information. JOSSO Identity Sources are schema-agnostic; they're capable of
                adapting to
                the schema supplied.

                The access protocol determines the set of messages for operating on user entries as well as the means
                of delivering these over the network. The most common access protocol used to locate user entries from a
                directory is LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).

                In order to offer their services to end-users and applications, SPs build on a third-party
                software piece which acts as the supporting infrastructure for distributed communication, security and
                connectivity,
                among others. In the specific case of supporting the execution of Web-based SPs
                - or simply Web applications - Web containers are used.

                Within this setting, Web access management concerns are handled by underlying security
                mechanisms which
                handle user authentication and authorization. When these processes are complete, the corresponding
                security context
                - namely valid claims concerning user identity - are passed on to the underlying Web application. Within
                the scope of the application, the security context can be leveraged further by performing finer-grained
                authorization or
                support
                application services in a business-specific way.

                While enterprise-grade SSO standards exist (i.e. SAML), there is no standard API for
                introducing
                SSO support onto Web applications. Therefore, in order for the SP to become
                SSO-enabled,
                the most common approach in SSO products is to impact on the codebase. This is usually accomplished by
                adapting
                an application's logic
               through coupling with the SSO vendor's application programming interfaces (the API) in order to harness
                any supplied
                SSO services.

                JOSSO takes a different approach. It leverages standard, as well as container-specific, application
                Security Service
                Provider interfaces (SPIs) in order to build the SSO capabilities onto the container, as opposed to the
                specific
                application.
                Therefore, as long as the SP consumes security services that are provided by the underlying
                container,
                it will become SSO-enabled in a transparent fashion.
                There's no need to partner it with any SSO vendor API; no need to have access to the application's
                source code, and no
                rebuilding of
                the application.

                Within the JOSSO domain, an execution environment is where SPs run in order to offer
                services to
                end users and applications.
                Execution environments can range from Web containers to application servers, Web portals to application
                platforms.
                Within the identity appliance model, defining the characteristics of an execution
                environment and binding it to an SP is key to activating SSO support onto
                the specific execution environment, and from there, onto the underlying applications.

                An activation connection is employed as the means for binding an SP with an execution
                environment.
                The semantics of the activation is covered in the 'Connections' section (TODO: point
                to 'Connections' section).

                The upcoming sections describe all the JOSSO-supported execution environments onto which service
                providers
                can build, for participation in a Federated SSO setting.

                In the previous chapter, we introduced all the building blocks - identity appliance elements - that
                can play a part in an Internet SSO
                setting.
                In order to put together a meaningful identity appliance model, one that can be transformed to something
                that
                can actually execute, all the different pieces need to be brought together.
                Connections are used to join two identity appliance elements.
                In our model, connections are edges, representing flows of control and
                data between identity appliance elements. Each connection enables a flow of data and control from one
                identity appliance element to
                another, creating a contract between the two elements.
                A connection is capable of associating identity appliance elements of a specific
                type.
                In the next section we'll cover the available connection elements.

                    Federated Identity Management describes a model which enables users to employ their digital identities in
                    collaborating organizations, regardless of organizational borders. The essential pre-requisite to
                    sharing
                    user authentication across different security domains is the establishment of trust between the
                    collaborating partners. Usually, this is done by setting up complex contracts, that describe common
                    policies, obligations and procedures that must be followed by each collaboration member.
                </p><p>
                    Multiple providers can connect to form a trust network, known as a Circle of Trust.
                    The trust system is based on a contract between separate parties and authentication that is
                    enforced using cryptographic
                    key certificates.
                    A federated connection allows the association of an IdP element with an SP element.
                    The federated connection defines a relationship of mutual trust between the service and the IdP,
                    indicating that one provider is willing to rely on the other
                    to handle its principal identities.
                </p><p>
                    Setting up a Circle of Trust among providers provides users with new value-added services
                    and enhanced operational efficiency, by delivering the SSO
                    experience in a cross-domain fashion.

                        Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication
                        and authorization data between security domains. That is, between an IdP (a
                        producer of assertions) and an SP (a consumer of assertions). SAML is a product of
                        the OASIS Security Services Technical Committee.
                    </p><p>
                        SAML assumes that the principal (often a user) has enrolled with at least one IdP. This
                       IdP is expected to provide local authentication services to the principal.
                        However, SAML does not specify the implementation of these local services; indeed, SAML does not
                        care how local authentication services are implemented (although individual SPs
                        most certainly will).
                        So an SP is reliant upon an IdP to identify the principal. At the
                        principal's request, the IdP passes a SAML assertion to the SP. On
                        the basis of this assertion, the SP makes an access control decision.
                    </p><p>
                        JOSSO is SAML 1.1 and 2 compliant. IdPs and SPs build on
                        exchanges based on SAML so that they can inter-operate in terms of identity management and realize
                        usage scenarios like cross-domain SSO.
                    </p><p>
                        From within the Identity Appliance Modeler, Identity and Service Provider entity elements are
                        SAML2-based. Consequently, a Federation Connection is a SAML2 Federation Connection,
                        given that it specifically deals with binding two SAML2 entities together.
                    </p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="Identity_Lookup"/>3.2.4.2. Identity Lookup</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    At some point, both IdPs and SPs need to rely on one or more authoritative sources
                    to
                    obtain user and entitlement entries. IdPs can then use this information to back
                    authentication
                    and authorization processes, as well as to populate security tokens with the claims thus derived.
                    On the other hand, SP's usage scenarios are close to the ones of an IdP.
                   SPs can consume user information from alternative authoritative identity sources, in
                    addition to relying
                    on claims submitted by one or more trusted IdPs. Within a typical federated identity
                    setting, upon relaying an authentication request from an IdP, SPs are able to
                    leverage an internal identity source to carry out the account linkage.  User
                    details are located
                    within the local authoritative source, based on the account identifier referenced by the Identity
                    Provider. Once a local account counterpart is obtained, the claims conveyed by the IdP
                    can be augmented with user details, obtained from the local authoritative source.
                </p><p>
                    An identity lookup connection defines the identity source as an entity - either IdP or SP - and
                    is willing to rely on that definintion to support identity and access management processes such as
                    those involving authentication and authorization.
                </p><p>
                    An identity lookup edge, connecting an IdP with an identity source, determines two things: which
                    authoritative identity source will be used, and what means will be employed in order to access the
                    source in order
                    to obtain
                    the user credentials required for performing authentication. Moreover, it specifies the authoritative
                    source from which user and entitlement details, that will populate security tokens, will be
                    obtained.
                </p><p>
                    An identity lookup edge, connecting an SP with an identity source, determines which
                    local authoritative identity source is going to be used as well as the means to access it.
                    In addition to relying on authentication requests from IdPs, SPs may
                    authenticate users in order to grant access to the protected resources that they host. In other words,
                    the local authoritative source may be used to obtain user credentials for supporting authentication.
                    In addition, the SP can be part of a Circle of Trust, relaying authentication
                    requests conveyed by trusted IdPs. In this case the SP can build on
                    the local authoritative source to obtain the local account record based on the name identifier
                    conveyed
                    in the authentication request. This procedure is known as Account Linkage. Based on the claims
                    conveyed by the IdP and the local account information, a new set of
                    claims can be created that will be passed on for application consumption. For instance, a user
                    having a set of
                    roles
                    at the IdP end, might have a different set of roles when navigating to a partner site,
                    which restrict the actions the user is entitled to perform within the target partner site.
                    Alternatively, in cases where a local account is not available for the supplied name identifier, the
                    SP can provision (i.e., create) it. This is known as Federated Provisioning.
                    This might be a requirement where SPs need to rely on a local account in addition
                    to the security context.
                </p><p>
                    The semantics placed for an identity lookup edge connecting an SP with an identity
                    source determine only how the identity source will be harnessed to feed the account linkage
                    operation.
                    What means will be employed by the SP to obtain user
                    credentials in
                    order
                    to carry out local authentication are still left undetermined.

                    One distinctive feature of JOSSO is the ability to support transparent SSO. In a nutshell, this
                    translates
                    to instant SSO-enablement of SPs, by removing the system integration effort involved
                    in leveraging the SSO solution which typically involved coupling with the SSO solution APIs.
                </p><p>
                    This feature is mainly based on SSO-enabling applications by JOSSifying the execution environments
                    on top of which they run; and passing on a security context that is standard-compliant (therefore accessible),
                    to any application which relies on standard security contracts - such as the JavaEE ones - for their
                    access control operations.  TBD: GB please review this sentence!
                </p><p>
                    An "activation" is a kind of connection for binding the SP to an execution environment,
                    applying SSO-enablement semantics to execution environments hosting SPs for a specific
                    identity appliance.
                </p><p>
                    The execution environment element type determines the specific SSO agent that will be
                    provisioned
                    for bringing the SSO capabilities on board for the associated SP.
                </p><p>
                    Activation is a two-phase process. The first phase involves introducing SSO-support onto the
                    target execution environment. This takes place at "design time"; during the modeling process of an
                    identity appliance.
                </p><p>
                    The second phase happens when the identity appliance model is transformed to an executable
                    artifact. Within this phase, the execution environment is set up so that it recognizes the service
                    providers that will be hosting .

        This is the first identity and access management product that employs a model-driven
        approach to visually specify and execute identity architectures. Even those of you who are not familiar
        with this approach - commonly referred as MDD (Model Driven Development) - may have actually been
        using tools based on this paradigm for more than a decade. For instance, Database Administrators
        use this approach to specify and set up database schemas; those of you involved in software engineering use
        diagramming tools to specify application designs and, eventually, to scaffold the code. There
        are many examples of MDD implementations out there, and almost every technical domain employs at least one of
        these tools to shorten learning curves and improve productivity. But we couldn't find one
        that addressed the inherent (and ever-increasing) complexity of the identity and access management space. At
        Atricore we felt that one was needed; so we built one. Then we delivered it, for free, with JOSSO2.

        Here's where the Atricore Console comes in. You can model an identity architecture and transform it into
        something that executes, without necessarily being exposed to the myriad technical details surrounding the
        process. Because of the strong JOSSO binding, in addition to enabling the services to realize your identity
        architecture, you can activate your target execution environments so that they'll be provisioned with the
        building blocks you need to deal with your setting in an out-of-the-box fashion. When we tested the first
        bits of the Atricore Console we were amazed at how much we were able to achieve with so little. We delivered a
        simple Federated SSO deployment in just fifteen minutes!

            Simply put, Model-Driven Identity (MDid) is the result of crossing model-driven development with identity
            and
            access management domains. To understand what MDId really is, you need to know one more thing: what, in this
            context, do we mean by a "model"? If you're familiar with Unified Modeling Language (UML), you
            might imagine a higher-level description of an application from which we can generate some (or all) of the
            implementation. In that case, you'd be right about what a "model" is, but not exactly about MDId's spin on
            it. Although the idea is the same, a model in MDId is less general and high-level than the commonly accepted
            interpretation. MDId doesn't require a completely different methodology, or any sophisticated modeling
            tools. All you need to get started with MDId is the Atricore Console, which is bundled in  JOSSO2. As you'll
            see in the following sections, MDId relates the modeling concepts portion of the identity and access
            management domain directly to their implementations, thereby bringing to JOSSO  - and to Identity Architects
            in general - the benefits of modeling, with a low cost of entry.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Modeling_vs_Implementing"/>4.2. Modeling vs. Implementing</h2></div></div></div><p>
            In a nutshell, Atricore Console is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is used to describe a
            model of an identity architecture, and then to generate the artifacts which bring that architecture to life.
            With Atricore Console, both modeling and implementing IAM (Identity Access Management) architecture can be
            considered as one and the same action. Instead of forcing a separation of the high-level engineering and modeling
            work from the low-level implementation activities, Atricore Console brings them together as two well-
           integrated parts of the same task. Why is modeling interesting for an IAM project in the first place? For
            starters, it gives you the ability to describe what your identity and access management solution is supposed
            to do (presumably) more easily than with dealing with configuration descriptors and code. In turn, this
            gives you a solid, high-level way to both communicate the identity architecture and to generate part, if not
            all, of the implementation artifacts.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="What is Model Driven Development"/>4.3. What is Model-Driven Development?</h2></div></div></div><p>
            MDD addresses full life cycle application development, data, and application integration standards that work
            with multiple middleware languages and interchange formats. MDD unifies some of the industry's best
            practices in software architecture, modeling, metadata management and software transformation technologies;
            practices that allow the user to develop a modeling specification just once, then target multiple technology
            implementations by using precise transformations and mappings. Atricore Console supports the key MDD concept
            of using models as input for development and integration tools. In Atricore Console, a model is used to
            drive the generation of identity and access management implementations.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="The Identity Architect Role"/>4.4. The Identity Architect Role</h2></div></div></div><p>
            Identity and Access Management projects require different roles in order to increase the chances for
            success. The fundamental roles are these: a Project Manager to keep track of the overall implementation;
            a Solution Architect capable of putting together solution blueprints; a System Integrator to ensure that all
            the identity architecture pieces of the solution play together nicely in both sandbox and production
            settings and a System Developer to introduce the customization required to make the underlying identity 
            suite match finer-grained usage scenarios as required by the business.
        </p><p>
            It's a sad fact that most identity and access management projects fail. The blame for this high failure
            rate can be shared by multiple areas for a myriad of reasons. Covering all of them lies beyond the scope of
            this
            document, but we're happy to take aim at one: the gap that exists between
            the roles of Solution Architect and System Integrator. The Solution Architect builds on different pieces of
            information to come up with a solution. These range from identity management use-case specifications to user
            stories, from quality attributes required for the technical architecture to resource availability and the
            capabilities available in the underlying product-and the list goes on.
            The outcome of the solution-building process is usually a set of artifacts - mainly technical documents -
            which contain the detailed descriptions and supporting diagrams of the identity management architecture.
            Let's say that these documents are 10,000', bird's-eye views of the solution. These are then passed on
            to the System Integrator in order to bring the proposed solution to life. Now the System Integrator must
            work up at 10,000'. New aspects related to the implementation tasks introduce significant changes,
            constraints and detail to the solution. But these valuable pieces of information are not brought back to the
            original solution blueprints. As the integration iterations flow, the artifacts covering the solution
            rapidly become stale, leaving the actual implementation as the only source available for parsing the identity
            and access management solution. Herein lies the problem. Understanding the
            solution
            architecture via the actual implementation requires detailed knowledge of the product and internals -
            which are scattered throughout the entire implementation. Gathering all the pieces together into an updated
            high-level view is a classic "mission impossible".
            In the advanced stages of the implementation, the Solution Architect tends to play a passive role, with
            little control over the project in terms of the identity architecture. The lack of control in this area
            represents a risk for the overall project, since the end product might not match stakeholder
            expectations, or scale as planned.
        </p><p>
            The role of Identity Architect is a relatively new one in the Identity and Access Management market.
            Responsible for putting the identity architecture together, like a builder/designer for
            identity and access management architecture, it's a similar role to that of the Solution Architect - but
            with
            some notable differences.
        </p><p>
            We think of an Identity Architect as the result of combining the roles of the Solution Architect and
            the System Integrator. The Identity Architect works with live architecture models, which act as the
            pieces that drive the realization of an identity architecture.
        </p><p>
            With this approach identity architecture blueprints are always up-to-date, since they're
             in sync with the underlying implementation. A live view of the architecture can be accessed at
            any time, along with the ability to extend or prototype it (among many other possibilities).
        </p><p>
            The Identity Appliance Modeler is the principle enabler of these processes, and serves a twofold purpose. It
            can be used to diagram the identity architecture as well as to realize it onto the target product suite.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Identity_Appliance_Modeler_Overview"/>4.5. Identity Appliance Modeler Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>
            While JOSSO1 provides a command line console in order to provision SSO support onto the target environment,
            users are still required to deal with low-level artifacts - such as XML descriptors - in order to fine tune
            the implementation. This creates
             a high entry barrier for less technically-savvy users, due to the learning curve involved with
            JOSSO and the constructs employed in order to set up the product to realize SSO usage
            scenarios. In addition, the people responsible for the identity architecture do not have visibility or
            control of the federated single sign-on setting, so they have to rely on more technically proficient people
            - usually not SME experts - in order to bring their project to life. Chances for
            miscommunication increase as a consequence, and that poses a significant risk to the identity and access
            management project.
        </p><p>
            With the Identity Appliance Modeler, the Identity Architect gains complete control of the process of
            mapping the high-level identity architecture to something that will actually execute. Definition of the
            identity
            architecture can be accomplished in a purely visual fashion, thus eliminating the high entry
            barrier that's typically required to engage in the delivery of Internet SSO.
        </p><p>
            Here's what the Identity Appliance Modeler looks like :
        </p><p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/modeler_birds_eye.png" align="middle"/></span>
        </p><p>
            The action bar offers operations related to the identity appliance. These are mainly concerned with managing
            the workspace within which an identity appliance model is bootstrapped and edited. For instance, an
            identity appliance can be scaffolded by clicking on the "New" button, or we can continue working on an
            existing appliance by selecting it and clicking on the "Open" button.
        </p><p>
            The Palette consists of four drawers. The "Entities" drawer holds the items used to specify the primary
            agents of the identity architecture, namely the Identity Provider and Service Provider. The "Identity
            Sources" drawer holds items used to specify the specific storage mechanism which will be leveraged to back
            authentication and authorization processes. The "Execution Environments" drawer holds items used to
            specify the application platform upon which service providers can execute. Finally, the "Connections"
            drawer holds the items used to connect the building blocks of the identity architecture together.
        </p><p>
            The Diagram Canvas plays the role of placeholder for all of the elements constituting an identity
            appliance model.
        </p><p>
            The Appliance Browser, on the left side of the Diagram Canvas, provides a tree view of the identity
            appliance model. Any change that's made to an identity appliance element is automatically reflected on the
            tree. Any time an element is selected on the tree, it is also selected on the Diagram Canvas and its details
            are presented on the property sheet panel.
        </p><p>
            The property sheet section is at the bottom of the Identity Appliance Modeler screen. It's the entry
            point for accessing the details of identity appliance elements, and it's where editing actions on those
            details take place.
        </p><p>
            In order to add an element to an existing identity appliance model, simply click on one of the
            items from the Palette and then drag and drop it onto the Diagram Canvas.
            Connecting two elements is achieved by dragging onto the diagram an item of the required connection type,
            then selecting the source and target elements you wish to associate together.
        </p><p>
            You can edit by clicking the element in question from the Diagram Canvas and selecting the
            field you wish to update within the property sheet section.
            Element removal is achieved by clicking on the red cross that appears when a rollover action is performed
            on an element of the diagram.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Identity_Appliance_Lifecycle_Management_Overview"/>4.6. Identity Appliance Life Cycle Management Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>
            The Identity Architect is also in control of transforming the identity architecture model into a
            fully executing artifact. As with the Identity Appliance Modeler, it's a simple point-and-click process.
            The Identity Appliance Life Cycle Management screen offers a grid-based layout, within which columns are
            used to
            represent the different states possible for the identity appliance artifact.
        </p><p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/lifecycle_birds_eye.png" align="middle"/></span>
        </p><p>
            Switching the identity appliance from one state to another is achieved by dragging the identity
            appliance item from the column representing the source state, and dropping it into the column representing
            the target state. For instance, in order to build an identity appliance: select and drag the
            corresponding item from the "Saved" column and drop it into the "Staged" column.
            Additionally, an identity appliance in the "Deployed" state can be started and stopped with the
            buttons located to the right of the item.

            JOSSO2 is bundled with an out-of-the-box identity store - known as Identity Vault - onto which user
            accounts and entitlements can be provisioned. Identity Vaults can be bound to both Identity and Service
            Provider entities. The identity vault is built on an Apache Derby relational database system.
        </p><p>
            Both accounts and groups can be provisioned. Accounts can also be associated to one or more groups in
            order to serve as the input for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

                de-provisioning.

        An identity appliance contains the definitions for the
        identity
        architecture. By leveraging the Identity Appliance Modeler, you can define identity appliances for
        realizing standards-based Internet SSO settings. Additional identity appliance flavors will be supported in
        future releases.
    </p><p>
        An identity appliance contains instances of the element types that conform to the identity appliance meta-model.
        These
        constructs can be dragged from the palette view and dropped into the identity appliance diagram. The
        identity services that
        will be available upon identity appliance deployment will be driven by the definitions that are part of this
        appliance. For instance, if we've specified a SAML2 Identity Provider (IdP), the endpoints for the chosen SAML
        profile
        and bindings will be enabled. Moreover, if this IdP is connected to an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
        Protocol),
        authentication will be
        based on user entries within the target directory. Multiple identity appliances can run simultaneously,
        representing distinctive facets of a large infrastructure, or - within a multi-tenant setting -
        the Federated Identity services for a specific tenant. Identity Appliances will run isolated from one another,
        yet be managed centrally through the Atricore Console.
    </p><p>
        An identity appliance can be created from scratch or scaffolded by building on reference identity appliance
        templates.
        Let's explore these options in more detail.
    </p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Starting_from_Scratch"/>5.1. Starting from Scratch</h2></div></div></div><p>
            Starting from scratch is usually the best option when your setting is very particular - there is
            template available that will match your setting. To create a new appliance, press on the "New"
            button with the "Empty Identity Appliance" item set on the select box on the right. This will open
            a dialog for specifying information to identify the target identity appliance.
        </p><p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/new_appliance_scratch.png" align="middle"/></span>
        </p><p>
            The Name field contains the unique identifier for the identity appliance. Choose an identifier that is
            within the parameters of the
            allowed
            character set, and that is not in use by another identity appliance.
        </p><p>
            The Description field is an informative field used to describe the function of the identity appliance.
            Characteristics like the owner's organization name and the type of service that will be implemented through
            the appliance can be defined here.
        </p><p>
            The Realm Name provides a unique namespace for the elements contained by the identity appliance. For
            instance,
            artifacts produced by an identity appliance transformation process: module identifiers, java classes, etc.
            will be qualified using the Realm Name.
            The Realm Name and the Identity Appliance Name are the building blocks of the fully qualified identity
            appliance name, or FQIAN.
        </p><p>
            The Appliance Location specifies the host name, and the port where identity endpoints for the identity
            appliance will be bound. We strongly suggest that you use a fully qualified host name, so that
            the identity appliance services are decoupled from a specific physical host.
        </p><p>
            Once the fields are filled in, press the "Accept" button. This will create an empty identity appliance,
            enabling
            the identity appliance modeling process.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Scaffolding_it"/>5.2. Scaffolding</h2></div></div></div><p>
            Scaffolding allows you to automatically generate a full blown Internet SSO setting based on an existing
            identity
            appliance template. By building on user-supplied attributes of the expected Internet SSO setting,
            Atricore
            Console is able to deliver a working identity appliance. This acts as the "scaffolding" over which
            the identity
            architect can layer their own custom identity appliance.
        </p><p>
            In order to scaffold an identity appliance, select the "Federated SSO Baseline" item and click on the
            "New" button. This will open a wizard application which will guide you through several steps
            for gathering the high-level attributes of the Internet SSO setting to be scaffolded.

                                    The Realm name and the Identity Appliance Name are the building blocks of the

            The second step involves setting up the building blocks of the trust system, which is based on
            Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The trust system provides for peer authentication, integrity,
            confidentiality and non-repudiation
            in a transport-agnostic fashion. The SAML standard - which JOSSO supports - builds on PKI to guarantee
            these security attributes for SSO message exchanges. The requested information is mainly
            used for providers to access private and public key pairs.

            The third step concerns Identity Provider-facing authentication and backing Identity Store
            preferences.

            Within the "Basic Authentication" section, you can specify preferences concerning
            user authentication.
            By default,
            only basic authentication - authentication based on username and password credentials - can be
            selected. In terms of where user and entitlement information is located, several storage technologies
            and
            access protocols can be used.
        </p><p>
            Within the "Users Repository" section, you'll mainly be specifying the identity source that will
            be attached to the Identity Provider, and which will be used for obtaining user details and entitlement
            entries.

                                    The identity appliance scaffolding wizard provides only one option to connect with
                                    a database system: through a JDBC-ODBC driver. This is meant for a
                                    Windows-based system - ODBC
                                    is a Windows standard- but it
                                    can also be used from a Linux host. Upon completion of the wizard, a native JDBC
                                    (type 4) driver can be
                                    substituted if the RDBMS vendor did not supply an ODBC driver, or if JOSSO is
                                    being hosted in a
                                    system that is
                                    running the Unix operating system (e.g. Linux).

            Within the "User Lookup" tab you can supply SQL queries that will be used by an Identity Provider
            to retrieve user credentials and details, as well as roles. Supplying this information is required, given
            that JOSSO is schema-agnostic and therefore requires the directives in order to adapt to an arbitrary
            schema.

            On the "Lookup" screen you can determine how user and role entries are to be
            retrieved. This is required in order to access identity data that responds to arbitrary
            schemas. This avoids forcing migrating user data to a product-specific user schema, allowing you to reuse
            existing identity silos independently of how user data is structured.

                                    JOSSO2 builds on legacy JOSSO1 Agents in order to realize SSO-enabling
                                    usage scenarios. JOSSO2 provides a compatibility layer, that complies with both
                                    the front and
                                    back-channel
                                    contracts of the JOSSO1 Gateway, making a JOSSO2 server instance appear as a
                                    plain old JOSSO1 Gateway.

            An Identity Vault is a type of Identity Source which is built in to the product. The account and
            entitlement management functionality can only act on ID Vaults instances. The ID Vault
            is based on an Apache Derby relational database engine. An ID Vault, like any identity source,
            can be bound to both an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider (SP). In the former case, the
            ID Vault is used to back authentication processes. In the latter case, the ID Vault is used to
            support account linkage, for augmenting IdP-facing claims with those provided by the local ID Vault.
        </p><p>
            An Identity Vault is represented in the figure below :
            TODO: insert identity vault figure
        </p><p>
            Using an ID Vault over a general purpose identity source allows you to leverage the existing visual
            account and entitlement management facilities, as well as decrease the time to deployment; since the
            activities involved in setting up an external identity store and linking it to the identity
            infrastructure are not required.

            LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol which enables anyone to locate
            organizations, individuals and other resources - such as files and devices - in a network, whether on the
            public Internet or on a corporate Intranet.
        </p><p>
            An LDAP Identity Source is a type of identity source which can be accessed through the LDAP protocol and
            which exposes user entries in a hierarchical form, responding to an arbitrary user schema.
        </p><p>
            TODO: insert identity source figure
        </p><p>
            LDAP Identity Sources can be bound to both Identity and Service Providers. Connecting an IdP to an LDAP
            Identity Source implies that queries for retrieving user records to back authentication and related
            processes will be performed against a directory using the LDAP Procotol.
            Connecting an SP to an Identity Source implies that queries meant to authenticate users locally, or to
            augment IdP-facing claims, will be backed by an directory accessible through the LDAP protocol. In order to
            adapt to arbitrary schemas - and realize schema-agnosticity - the identity source can be customized in terms
            of the LDAP queries used to access user identity records.
        </p><p>
            From the Palette, click "LDAP Identity Source" in the "Identity Sources" drawer.
        </p><p>
            Click on and drag the "LDAP Identity Source" element to the preferred location within the Diagram Canvas.

            On the "Lookup" screen, you can determine how user and role entries are to be retrieved. This is required in
            order to access identity data responding to arbitrary schemas. The forced migration of user data to a
            product-specific user schema is avoided, allowing you to re-use existing identity silos independently of
            user data structure.

            RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS data is structured in database tables,
            fields and records. Each RDBMS table consists of database table rows. Each database table row consists of
            one or more database table fields.
        </p><p>
            An RDBMS Identity Source is a type of identity source which is accessible through the vendor's JDBC
            (Java Database Connectivity) driver. The JDBC driver hides the internal details of the protocol used 
            to access databases.
        </p>
        TODO: insert identity source figure

        <p>
            Within an RDBMS, user details are stored in database rows grouped using tables. Each single user
            attribute is stored in table fields. User information might span to more than one table.
            For instance, user details can be spanned in two different tables: one for holding user attributes and
            another for holding the related entitlement records.
        </p><p>
            RDBMS Identity Sources can be bound to both Identity and Service Providers. Connecting an IdP to an RDBMS
            Identity Source implies that queries for retrieving user records (in order to back authentication and
            related processes) will be performed against a database using the supplied JDBC driver.
        </p><p>
            Connecting a Service Provider to an Identity Source implies that queries meant to authenticate users
            locally, or to augment IdP-facing claims, will be backed by a database made accessible through the supplied
            JDBC driver.
        </p><p>
            In order to adapt to arbitrary schemas - and realize schema-agnosticity - the identity source can be
            customized in terms of the SQL queries that are used to access user identity records.

                                    The only available option for connecting with a database system, that is allowed
                                    from the identity appliance scaffolding wizard, is through a JDBC-ODBC driver.
                                    This approach is tailored to a Windows-based system (Open Database
                                    Connectivity, or ODBC, is a Windows standard) but it can also be made to work from
                                    a Linux
                                    host. Upon completion of the scaffolding
                                    wizard, a native JDBC (Type 4) driver can be used, in case the RDBMS vendor has not
                                    supplied an ODBC driver, or if JOSSO is being hosted in a system running the Unix
                                    operating system (e.g. Linux).

            XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a flexible way to create common information formats and share both
            the format and the data on the Internet, intranets, and elsewhere. XML's design goals emphasize simplicity,
            generality, and Internet usability. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for
            the representation of arbitrary data structures, for example in Web services.

            An XML identity source is a type of identity source that is based on a hierarchical information model.
            The basic building blocks of XML are elements and attributes. Elements describe data, whereas attributes
            are like the properties of an element, in that they provide further definition of the element. The
            semantics of XML documents are defined using XML schemas, through which it becomes possible to define the
            individual elements and attributes, and to assign valid types to them.

            An XML Identity Source needs to be backed by a single XML document responding to a JOSSO-specific
            schema. Such a document should be stored in a file system that can be accessed by the JOSSO server.
            Both user details and entitlement records are stored in a single XML document. User credentials are stored
            in a separate file due to the sensitive nature of the information.

            Here's a sample of XML documents, showing user details and entitlement records:

        In order to enable an Internet SSO setting you'll need at least one entity playing the role of Identity
        Provider (IdP). An IdP manages your identity, and provides an authentication service for
        client applications. IdPs authenticate users and issue security tokens - like Security
        Assertions Markup Language (SAML). Security Tokens contain user IDs and other identity properties of
        the user (claims). Examples of some IdPs are: Windows Live ID, Google Accounts and Facebook.
    </p><p>
        Security Tokens issued by the IdP - upon successful user authentication - are pushed to
        the parties who rely upon them, commonly known as Service Providers. A Service Provider (SP) is an application
        that relies on the
        claims issued by an IdP to authorize a user, and to release appropriate access to that user.
    </p><p>
        We're assuming that you are beginning with an empty Identity Appliance, with no defined IdP.

            The default location is built using attributes supplied at identity appliance-creation time. For the sake of
            consistency, we strongly suggest that you leave these default attributes "as-is".

                                    SAML Authentication Assertions provides confidentiality to SAML messages,
                                    therefore
                                    avoiding eavesdropping.

            screen select the keystores holding the private and public key pairs used to secure SAML message exchanges
            between SPs and the IdP.
            </p><p>
                The second step involves setting up the building blocks of the trust system, which is based on
                public key infrastructure (PKI). The trust system allows for provision of peer authentication, integrity,
                confidentiality and non-repudiation
                in a transport-agnostic fashion. The SAML standard - which JOSSO supports - builds on PKI to
                guarantee
                these security attributes for SSO message exchanges. The requested information is mainly
                used by providers, to access private and public key pairs.

            This involves setting up the building blocks of the trust system, which is based on
            public key infrastructure (PKI). The trust system provides peer authentication, integrity,

            in a transport-agnostic fashion. The SAML standard - which JOSSO supports - builds on PKI to
            guarantee
            these security attributes for SSO message exchanges. The requested information is mainly
            used for providers to access private and public key pairs.

                The Apache HTTP Server is a popular open source, standard, secure, efficient and extensible

                An Apache HTTP Server can run virtually all types of web applications, such as those written in

                Establishing an activation connection between an SP and an Apache Web Server Execution
                Environment implies that the SP is a web application, hosted by an Apache Web Server
                instance.

                There is no support for automatic activation upon an Apache Web Server execution environment that is

                Applications running under Apache Web Server can be SSO-enabled seamlessly, without
                having to couple the application to the underlying SSO infrastructure, and deal with SSO internals.

                Once a successful security context is established, the web application - playing the service
                provider role - can consume it by relying on the REMOTE_USER environment variable set as the JOSSO Agent
                for
                Apache Web Server.
            </p><p>
                This variable contains the user name of the authenticated user.
                The REMOTE_USER value can be used to search for the user details as well as any other
                business-specific user profile information.

                WebLogic Server is a J2EE-compliant application server, produced by Oracle. It implements the
                full range of J2EE technologies, and provides features such as advanced management, clustering,
                and web services. It forms the core of the WebLogic platform, and provides a framework for
                building scalable, highly available and secure applications.
            </p><p>
                JOSSO supports SSO-enabling JavaEE applications running under Oracle WebLogic Server 9 and 10.
                Both web and business layers can be SSO-enabled. For instance, within a 3 or n-tier setting,
                once the security context is established on the web tier, JOSSO will seamlessly propagate it
                to the potentially distributed business tier. A business tier realized using Enterprise Java Beans
                (EJB) - namely Session Beans - will then be able to leverage the security context by applying
                the EJB-specific access control rules in both declarative - through Java annotations - and
                programmatic form.
            </p><p>
                The figure used to represent a WebLogic Server Execution Environment is the following :
                TODO: insert WebLogic Server Execution Environment Figure
            </p><p>
                Establishing an activation connection between an SP and a WebLogic Execution
                Environment
                implies that the SP is a standard JavaEE application hosted by a WebLogic Server
                instance.
            </p><p>
                Launching the activation on an WebLogic Server execution environment triggers the provisioning of
                the specific SSO Agent for the target WebLogic Server instance.
            </p><p>
                Once a successful security context is established, the web application - playing the service
                provider
                role -
                can consume it by relying on the security methods of the standard Servlet APIs.
            </p><p>
                The getUserPrincipal method can be used to return the javax.security.Principal object that contains the
                SSO user principal. The outcome of this method can be casted to the JOSSOUser class
                for the specific release of the Apache Tomcat Agent, allowing you to access SSO-specific properties,
                such as all the asserted claims for the user.
            </p><p>
                The isUserInRole allows you to assert if the remote user is granted the specified security role.
                Through this operation, it's possible to perform Role-based Access Control based on the supplied
                entitlement claims.
            </p><p>
                Within a business tier realized as Enterprise Java Beans, two approaches can be used for authorizing
                the caller: Declarative and Programmatic Authorization.
                With the declarative approach, access roles are defined in either the EJB descriptor or directly in
                the EJB class, using Java annotations.
                With the programmatic approach , the EJBContext.isCallerInRole method can be used to perform
                finer-grained
                access control.
                Both declarative and programmatic authorization can be used, building on the security context
                established by JOSSO.

                The Websphere Community Edition - also known as WASCE - is an open source application server
                developed by the Apache Software Foundation and distributed under the Apache license.
                It is the free edition of IBM WebSphere application server and is based on Geronimo.
            </p><p>
                JOSSO supports SSO-enabling JavaEE applications running under WASCE 2.1 .
                Both web and business layers can be SSO-enabled. For instance, within a 3 or n-tier setting,
                once the security context is established on the web tier, JOSSO will seamlessly propagate it
                to the potentially distributed business tier. A business tier realized using Enterprise Java Beans
                (EJB) - namely Session Beans - will then be able to leverage the security context by applying
                the EJB-specific access control rules in both declarative - through Java annotations - and
                programmatic form.
            </p><p>
                The figure used to represent a Websphere Execution Environment:
                TODO: insert Websphere Community Edition Execution Environment Figure
            </p><p>
                Establishing an activation connection between an SP and a Websphere Community
                Edition Execution Environment
                implies that the SP is a standard JavaEE application, hosted by a Websphere
                Community Edition Server instance.
            </p><p>
                Launching the activation on an Websphere Community Edition execution environment triggers the
                provisioning of
                the specific SSO Agent for the target instance.
            </p><p>
                Once a successful security context is established, the web application - playing the service
                provider
                role -
                can consume it by relying on the security methods of the standard Servlet APIs.
            </p><p>
                The getUserPrincipal method can be used to return a javax.security.Principal object, that contains the
                SSO user principal. The outcome of this method can be casted to the JOSSOUser class
                for the specific release of the Apache Tomcat Agent, allowing you to access SSO-specific properties,
                such as all the asserted claims for the user.
            </p><p>
                The isUserInRole allows you to assert if the remote user is granted a specified security role.
                Through this operation, it's possible to perform Role-based Access Control based on the supplied
                entitlement claims.
            </p><p>
                Within a business tier realized as Enterprise Java Beans, two approaches can be used for authorizing
                the caller : Declarative and Programmatic Authorization.
                In the declarative approach, access roles are defined in either the EJB descriptor or directly in
                the EJB class using Java annotations.
                In the programmatic approach, the EJBContext.isCallerInRole method can be used to perform
                finer-grained
                access control.
                Both declarative and programmatic authorization can be used, building on the security context
                established by JOSSO.

                Apache Tomcat (or Jakarta Tomcat or simply Tomcat) is an open source servlet container developed by
                the
                Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Tomcat implements the Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP)
                specifications from Sun Microsystems, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for
                Java
                code to run.
            </p><p>
                JOSSO supports SSO-enabling JavaEE web applications running under Apache Tomcat 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0 .

                The figure for representing an Apache Tomcat Execution Environment is the following :

            </p><p>
                Establishing an activation connection between an SP and a Tomcat Execution Environment
                implies that the SP is a standard Java Web Application, hosted by an Apache Tomcat
                container.
            </p><p>
                Launching the activation on an Apache Tomcat Execution Environment triggers the provisioning of
                the SSO Agent for this web container.
            </p><p>
                Once a successful security context is established, the web application - playing the SP
                role -
                can consume it by relying on the security methods of the standard Servlet APIs.

                The getUserPrincipal method can be used to return a javax.security.Principal object that contains the
                SSO user principal. The outcome of this method can be casted to the JOSSO User class
                pertaining
                to the specific release of the Apache Tomcat Agent, allowing you to access SSO-specific properties, such
                as all
                the asserted claims for the user.
            </p><p>
                The isUserInRole allows you to assert if the remote user is granted the specified security role.
                Through this operation it's possible to perform Role-based Access Control based on the supplied
                entitlement
                claims.

                JBoss is a Java EE certified platform for developing and deploying enterprise Java applications, Web
                applications, and Portals. JBoss Application Server provides the full range of Java EE 5 features, as
                well as extended enterprise services including clustering, caching, and persistence.
            </p><p>
                The Web Server component of the JBoss Application Server is the JBoss Web Server. The JBoss Web
                Server
                is an enterprise-ready web server designed for medium and large applications, based on Apache
                Tomcat,
                providing a single deployment platform for Java Server Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies,
                PHP, and CGI.
            </p><p>
                JOSSO supports SSO-enabling JavaEE applications running under JBoss 3.2, 4.0, 4.2 and 5.0 . Both web
                and
                business layers can be SSO-enabled. For instance, within a 3 or n-tier setting,
                once the security context is established on the web tier, JOSSO will seamlessly propagate it
                to the potentially distributed business tier. A business tier realized using Enterprise Java Beans
                (EJB) - namely Session Beans - will then be able to leverage the security context by applying
                the EJB-specific access control rules in both declarative - through Java annotations - and
                programmatic form.

                SSO user principal. The outcome of this method can be casted to the JOSSOUser class
                for the specific release of the Apache Tomcat Agent, allowing you to access SSO-specific properties,
                such as all the asserted claims for the user.
            </p><p>
                The isUserInRole allows you to assert if the remote user is granted the specified security role.
                Therefore,
                through this operation it's possible to perform Role-based Access Control based on the supplied
                entitlement
                claims.

                Within a business tier realized as Enteprise Java Beans, two approaches can be used for authorizing
                the caller: Declarative and Programmatic Authorization.
                In the declarative approach access roles are defined in either the EJB descriptor or directly in
                the EJB class using Java annotations.
                In the programmatic approach , the EJBContext.isCallerInRole method can be used to perform
                finer-grained
                access control.
                Both declarative and programmatic authorization can be used, building on the security context
                established by JOSSO.

        A Circle of Trust is a group of Service Providers that share linked identities and have pertinent business
        agreements in place regarding how to do business and interact with identities.
    </p><p>
        The first and most obvious way in which trust is established, is through existing relationships with
        partners, vendors and customers. If
        your organization already has agreements in place with another organization and you have a history of
        working together, they're already part of your circle.
    </p><p>
        Having put together the building blocks of an Identity Appliance defining at least one Identity Provider (IdP)
        and a
        set of Service Providers, the next step is to enable a seamless SSO experience for users to leverage when
        consuming
        the business services provided by the Service Provider (SP).
    </p><p>
        This is accomplished by creating a relationship of trust between IdPs and SPs, who
        agree to honor one another's authentication and authorization information.

        represent the different states the identity appliance artifact can be in.
        Transitioning the identity appliance from one state to another state is achieved by dragging the identity
        appliance item from one table of the grid - representing the source state - and dropping it onto the table
        representing the target state.

            Enabling an Identity Appliance Model to deliver the specified identity and access
            management services requires that you transform it to an executable artifact. Simply put, the executable
            artifact onto which an identity appliance is mapped is a set of JOSSO2 descriptors that are packaged as an
            OSGi bundle. JOSSO2 descriptors contribute identity and access management service definitions - such as
            SAML endpoints - to the underlying core.
        </p><p>
            In order to build an identity appliance, select the corresponding row for the target identity appliance
            within the "Saved" table of the lifecycle management grid.
        </p><p>
            The "Saved" table holds entries for the identity appliances that are candidates for
            compilation, and will ultimately be deployed and executed. Within this state, identity appliances can be
            edited and removed. To continue with the design process, click on the TBD:insert image button to
            open the identity appliance within the modeler view. To delete an identity appliance, click
            on the TBD: insert image button.
        </p><p>
            To build an identity appliance, select and drag the row for the target identity appliance item
            from the "Saved" table and drop it onto the "Staged" table of the grid. If the operation is
            successful, the target identity appliance will appear in the "Deployed" table of the lifecycle
            management grid.

            Once an identity appliance has been transformed to an executable artifact it is still not available for
            execution, since the underlying execution environment is not aware of its existence. In order to
            execute an identity appliance you must first deploy it by installing the corresponding artifact onto
            the JOSSO2 execution environment.
        </p><p>
            The identity appliances candidates for deployment are shown in the "Staged" table of the lifecycle
            management grid.
        </p><p>
            The "Staged" table holds entries for the identity appliances that have been successfully compiled.
            Within this state, identity appliances can be viewed and rebuilt. To continue the design process, click
            on the TBD: insert image button to open the identity appliance within the modeler view. Then, click on the
            TBD:insert image button to rebuild the identity appliance (required in order to achieve visibility of the
            latest changes made in the editing session).
        </p><p>
            To deploy an identity appliance, select and drag the row for the target identity appliance item
            from the "Staged" table and drop it onto the "Deployed" table. The target identity appliance should appear
            in the "Deployed" table of the lifecycle management grid.

            Once an identity appliance has been deployed - meaning that it is now hosted within the JOSSO2 execution
            environment - it is available for execution.
        </p><p>
            The "Deployed" table holds the entries for identity appliances which have been deployed and are candidates
            for execution. Within the deployed state, identity appliances can be either running or stopped. The
            "State" column shows the identity appliance's current state. Possible states include: "Deployed", "Started"
            or "Stopped". The deployed state, identified as "DEPLOYED" in the State column, represents identity
            appliances which have been deployed, but have not been started. The started state ("STARTED" in the State
            column) represents identity appliances which have been deployed and started. These identity appliance
            definitions are being realized through identity and access management services which are available
            to consumers. Finally, the stopped state ("STOPPED" in the State column) represents identity
            appliances that are no longer executing. Services corresponding to these identity appliance
            definitions are no longer up and running. Within the "Actions" columns three actions can be applied to the
            identity appliance: "Start","Stop" and "Undeploy".

            This can be accomplished in two distinct ways:
            1) Click on the TBD: insert image button to dispose of an identity appliance, transitioning it to the
            "Disposed" state.
            2) Select and drag the row for the target identity appliance item from the "Staged" table and drop it onto
            the "Disposed" table.
            The target Identity Appliance will be disposed and transitioned to the "Disposed" state, and should appear
            in the "Disposed" table of the lifecycle management grid.

            An identity appliance that is no longer in use may be discarded and completely erased from the system.
            Once an identity appliance is removed, it cannot be recovered.
        </p><p>
            Disposal can be realized for appliances in either the "Saved" and "Disposed" states.
            The "Disposed" table holds the entries for the identity appliances that have been discarded, and are no
            longer available to be edited or executed. Identity Appliances within this states are candidates for
            definitive removal.
        </p><p>
            In order to dispose of an identity appliance in the "Disposed" table, select the row for the identity
            appliance and click on the TBD: insert image button within the state column. The disposed-of identity
            appliance should no longer show up within the state-specific tables of the lifecycle management grid.

        Generally speaking, when you add users and groups using the administration console, you're adding
        that data to the database on top of which the identity vault is founded.
        By default, even if you use an external identity source such as an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
        directory, the users you add
        through the console will be added to JOSSO's identity vault and not to the external identity
        source.

        A user account represents a person using the application's members of a circle of trust.
        Each user account has associated attributes which make up the person's profile.
        The console can be used to change any user's name and password, and to view and/or edit their
        profile information.
        It's also possible to disable a user (if, for example, that user is no longer involved) but it's best to
        preserve their
        profile information.
    </p><p>
        A group collects user accounts, typically in order to make it easier to grant all of the
        collected users certain entitlements. For example, you might create a group of human resources workers
        so
        that you can give them (and only them) permission to view potentially sensitive information about
        employees in a "Benefits" space.
        As an Administrator, you can add users and groups, and assign users to groups in order to determine
        their
        permissions.
