Connecting Identity Providers with Service Providers</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>
        A Circle of Trust is a group of Service Providers that share linked identities and have pertinent business
        agreements in place regarding how to do business and interact with identities.
    </p><p>
        The first and most obvious way in which trust is established, is through existing relationships with
        partners, vendors and customers. If
        your organization already has agreements in place with another organization and you have a history of
        working together, they're already part of your circle.
    </p><p>
        Having put together the building blocks of an Identity Appliance defining at least one Identity Provider (IdP)
        and a
        set of Service Providers, the next step is to enable a seamless SSO experience for users to leverage when
        consuming
        the business services provided by the Service Provider (SP).
    </p><p>
        This is accomplished by creating a relationship of trust between IdPs and SPs, who
        agree to honor one another's authentication and authorization information.

            To connect IdP and SP elements in order to create a relationship of trust, use the "Federated Connection"
            edge available in the "Connections" palette drawer.
        </p><p>
            Click on the "Federation Connection" element. Select the SP and drag the edge onto the target IdP.
        </p><p>
            The following dialog will appear for defining the characteristics of the federation connection between
            the chosen entities.
