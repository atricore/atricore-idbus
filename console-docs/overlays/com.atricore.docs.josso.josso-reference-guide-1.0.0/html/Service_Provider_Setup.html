        Once an IdP has been defined as the identity source that will be used to back authentication processes, the next
        step is to define the trusted partner sites that will consume the claims made by the IdP on behalf of
        any given user.
    </p><p>
        Service Providers will build on this claim set to authorize service requests made by
        end users and applications.
    </p><p>
        From the Palette, click "Service Provider" in the "Entities" drawer.
    </p><p>
        Drag the "Service Provider" element to the preferred location within the Diagram Canvas.
    </p><p>
        In the "New Service Provider Definition" window, enter the name of the Service Provider (SP).
    </p><p>
        On the "Core" screen, specify how consumers will reach the endpoints of the SP.
        The default location is built using attributes supplied at identity appliance-creation time. For the sake of
        consistency, we strongly suggest leaving the attributes as-is.

            This involves setting up the building blocks of the trust system, which is based on
            public key infrastructure (PKI). The trust system provides peer authentication, integrity,
            confidentiality and non-repudiation
            in a transport-agnostic fashion. The SAML standard - which JOSSO supports - builds on PKI to
            guarantee
            these security attributes for SSO message exchanges. The requested information is mainly
            used for providers to access private and public key pairs.

                instance.
            </p><p>
                There is no support for automatic activation upon an Apache Web Server execution environment that is
                connected with an SP.
            </p><p>
                Applications running under Apache Web Server can be SSO-enabled seamlessly, without
                having to couple the application to the underlying SSO infrastructure, and deal with SSO internals.
            </p><p>
                Once a successful security context is established, the web application - playing the service
                provider role - can consume it by relying on the REMOTE_USER environment variable set as the JOSSO Agent
                for
                Apache Web Server.
            </p><p>
                This variable contains the user name of the authenticated user.
                The REMOTE_USER value can be used to search for the user details as well as any other
                business-specific user profile information.

                Java Platform, Enterprise Edition or Java EE is a widely used platform for server programming in the

                WebLogic Server is a J2EE-compliant application server, produced by Oracle. It implements the
                full range of J2EE technologies, and provides features such as advanced management, clustering,
                and web services. It forms the core of the WebLogic platform, and provides a framework for
                building scalable, highly available and secure applications.
            </p><p>
                JOSSO supports SSO-enabling JavaEE applications running under Oracle WebLogic Server 9 and 10.
                Both web and business layers can be SSO-enabled. For instance, within a 3 or n-tier setting,
                once the security context is established on the web tier, JOSSO will seamlessly propagate it
                to the potentially distributed business tier. A business tier realized using Enterprise Java Beans
                (EJB) - namely Session Beans - will then be able to leverage the security context by applying
                the EJB-specific access control rules in both declarative - through Java annotations - and
                programmatic form.
            </p><p>
                The figure used to represent a WebLogic Server Execution Environment is the following :
                TODO: insert WebLogic Server Execution Environment Figure
            </p><p>
                Establishing an activation connection between an SP and a WebLogic Execution
                Environment
                implies that the SP is a standard JavaEE application hosted by a WebLogic Server
                instance.
            </p><p>
                Launching the activation on an WebLogic Server execution environment triggers the provisioning of
                the specific SSO Agent for the target WebLogic Server instance.
            </p><p>
                Once a successful security context is established, the web application - playing the service
                provider
                role -
                can consume it by relying on the security methods of the standard Servlet APIs.
            </p><p>
                The getUserPrincipal method can be used to return the javax.security.Principal object that contains the
                SSO user principal. The outcome of this method can be casted to the JOSSOUser class
                for the specific release of the Apache Tomcat Agent, allowing you to access SSO-specific properties,
                such as all the asserted claims for the user.
            </p><p>
                The isUserInRole allows you to assert if the remote user is granted the specified security role.
                Through this operation, it's possible to perform Role-based Access Control based on the supplied
                entitlement claims.
            </p><p>
                Within a business tier realized as Enterprise Java Beans, two approaches can be used for authorizing
                the caller: Declarative and Programmatic Authorization.
                With the declarative approach, access roles are defined in either the EJB descriptor or directly in
                the EJB class, using Java annotations.
                With the programmatic approach , the EJBContext.isCallerInRole method can be used to perform
                finer-grained
                access control.
                Both declarative and programmatic authorization can be used, building on the security context
                established by JOSSO.

                Apache Tomcat (or Jakarta Tomcat or simply Tomcat) is an open source servlet container developed by
                the
                Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Tomcat implements the Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP)
                specifications from Sun Microsystems, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for
                Java
                code to run.
            </p><p>
                JOSSO supports SSO-enabling JavaEE web applications running under Apache Tomcat 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0 .
            </p><p>
                The figure for representing an Apache Tomcat Execution Environment is the following :
                TODO: insert Apache Tomcat Execution Environment Figure
            </p><p>
                Establishing an activation connection between an SP and a Tomcat Execution Environment
                implies that the SP is a standard Java Web Application, hosted by an Apache Tomcat
                container.
            </p><p>
                Launching the activation on an Apache Tomcat Execution Environment triggers the provisioning of
                the SSO Agent for this web container.
            </p><p>
                Once a successful security context is established, the web application - playing the SP
                role -
                can consume it by relying on the security methods of the standard Servlet APIs.
            </p><p>
                The getUserPrincipal method can be used to return a javax.security.Principal object that contains the
                SSO user principal. The outcome of this method can be casted to the JOSSO User class
                pertaining
                to the specific release of the Apache Tomcat Agent, allowing you to access SSO-specific properties, such
                as all
                the asserted claims for the user.
            </p><p>
                The isUserInRole allows you to assert if the remote user is granted the specified security role.
                Through this operation it's possible to perform Role-based Access Control based on the supplied
                entitlement
                claims.

                JBoss is a Java EE certified platform for developing and deploying enterprise Java applications, Web
                applications, and Portals. JBoss Application Server provides the full range of Java EE 5 features, as
                well as extended enterprise services including clustering, caching, and persistence.
            </p><p>
                The Web Server component of the JBoss Application Server is the JBoss Web Server. The JBoss Web
                Server
                is an enterprise-ready web server designed for medium and large applications, based on Apache
                Tomcat,
                providing a single deployment platform for Java Server Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies,
                PHP, and CGI.
            </p><p>
                JOSSO supports SSO-enabling JavaEE applications running under JBoss 3.2, 4.0, 4.2 and 5.0 . Both web
                and
                business layers can be SSO-enabled. For instance, within a 3 or n-tier setting,
                once the security context is established on the web tier, JOSSO will seamlessly propagate it
                to the potentially distributed business tier. A business tier realized using Enterprise Java Beans
                (EJB) - namely Session Beans - will then be able to leverage the security context by applying
                the EJB-specific access control rules in both declarative - through Java annotations - and
                programmatic form.
            </p><p>
                The figure for representing an Apache Tomcat Execution Environment is the following :
                TODO: insert Apache Tomcat Execution Environment Figure
            </p><p>
                Establishing an activation connection between an SP and a JBoss Execution Environment
                implies that the SP is a standard JavaEE application hosted by a JBoss Application
                Server.
            </p><p>
                Launching the activation on an Apache Tomcat Execution Environment triggers the provisioning of
                the specific SSO Agent for the target JBoss Application Server instance.
            </p><p>
                Once a successful security context is established, the web application - playing the service
                provider
                role -
                can consume it by relying on the security methods of the standard Servlet APIs.
            </p><p>
                The getUserPrincipal method can be used to returnthe  javax.security.Principal object that contains the
                SSO user principal. The outcome of this method can be casted to the JOSSOUser class
                for the specific release of the Apache Tomcat Agent, allowing you to access SSO-specific properties,
                such as all the asserted claims for the user.
            </p><p>
                The isUserInRole allows you to assert if the remote user is granted the specified security role.
                Therefore,
                through this operation it's possible to perform Role-based Access Control based on the supplied
                entitlement
                claims.
            </p><p>
                Within a business tier realized as Enteprise Java Beans, two approaches can be used for authorizing
                the caller: Declarative and Programmatic Authorization.
                In the declarative approach access roles are defined in either the EJB descriptor or directly in
                the EJB class using Java annotations.
                In the programmatic approach , the EJBContext.isCallerInRole method can be used to perform
                finer-grained
                access control.
                Both declarative and programmatic authorization can be used, building on the security context
                established by JOSSO.
