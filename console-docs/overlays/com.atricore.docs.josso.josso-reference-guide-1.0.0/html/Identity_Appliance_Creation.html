        An identity appliance contains the definitions for the
        identity
        architecture. By leveraging the Identity Appliance Modeler, you can define identity appliances for
        realizing standards-based Internet SSO settings. Additional identity appliance flavors will be supported in
        future releases.
    </p><p>
        An identity appliance contains instances of the element types that conform to the identity appliance meta-model.
        These
        constructs can be dragged from the palette view and dropped into the identity appliance diagram. The
        identity services that
        will be available upon identity appliance deployment will be driven by the definitions that are part of this
        appliance. For instance, if we've specified a SAML2 Identity Provider (IdP), the endpoints for the chosen SAML
        profile
        and bindings will be enabled. Moreover, if this IdP is connected to an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
        Protocol),
        authentication will be
        based on user entries within the target directory. Multiple identity appliances can run simultaneously,
        representing distinctive facets of a large infrastructure, or - within a multi-tenant setting -
        the Federated Identity services for a specific tenant. Identity Appliances will run isolated from one another,
        yet be managed centrally through the Atricore Console.
    </p><p>
        An identity appliance can be created from scratch or scaffolded by building on reference identity appliance
        templates.
        Let's explore these options in more detail.
    </p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Starting_from_Scratch"/>5.1. Starting from Scratch</h2></div></div></div><p>
            Starting from scratch is usually the best option when your setting is very particular - there is
            template available that will match your setting. To create a new appliance, press on the "New"
            button with the "Empty Identity Appliance" item set on the select box on the right. This will open
            a dialog for specifying information to identify the target identity appliance.
        </p><p>
            <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/new_appliance_scratch.png" align="middle"/></span>
        </p><p>
            The Name field contains the unique identifier for the identity appliance. Choose an identifier that is
            within the parameters of the
            allowed
            character set, and that is not in use by another identity appliance.
        </p><p>
            The Description field is an informative field used to describe the function of the identity appliance.
            Characteristics like the owner's organization name and the type of service that will be implemented through
            the appliance can be defined here.
        </p><p>
            The Realm Name provides a unique namespace for the elements contained by the identity appliance. For
            instance,
            artifacts produced by an identity appliance transformation process: module identifiers, java classes, etc.
            will be qualified using the Realm Name.
            The Realm Name and the Identity Appliance Name are the building blocks of the fully qualified identity
            appliance name, or FQIAN.
        </p><p>
            The Appliance Location specifies the host name, and the port where identity endpoints for the identity
            appliance will be bound. We strongly suggest that you use a fully qualified host name, so that
            the identity appliance services are decoupled from a specific physical host.
        </p><p>
            Once the fields are filled in, press the "Accept" button. This will create an empty identity appliance,
            enabling
            the identity appliance modeling process.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Scaffolding_it"/>5.2. Scaffolding</h2></div></div></div><p>
            Scaffolding allows you to automatically generate a full blown Internet SSO setting based on an existing
            identity
            appliance template. By building on user-supplied attributes of the expected Internet SSO setting,
            Atricore
            Console is able to deliver a working identity appliance. This acts as the "scaffolding" over which
            the identity
            architect can layer their own custom identity appliance.
        </p><p>
            In order to scaffold an identity appliance, select the "Federated SSO Baseline" item and click on the
            "New" button. This will open a wizard application which will guide you through several steps
            for gathering the high-level attributes of the Internet SSO setting to be scaffolded.

        </p><p>
            The second step involves setting up the building blocks of the trust system, which is based on
            Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The trust system provides for peer authentication, integrity,
            confidentiality and non-repudiation
            in a transport-agnostic fashion. The SAML standard - which JOSSO supports - builds on PKI to guarantee
            these security attributes for SSO message exchanges. The requested information is mainly
            used for providers to access private and public key pairs.

                                    IdP to use
                                    the built-in identity source based on a relational database management system
                                    (RDBMS) and schema.
                                    The identity vault is the target for provisioning actions performed through the
                                    Account and Entitlement Management interface. This is the suggested
                                    option if you want JOSSO to use a dedicated identity store, and wish to
                                    benefit from GUI-based and integrated account and entitlement management.

                                    accessible through the LDAP protocol. Connection properties for the LDAP

                                    obtain account and entitlement entries. This is recommended only for sandbox

                                    The identity appliance scaffolding wizard provides only one option to connect with
                                    a database system: through a JDBC-ODBC driver. This is meant for a
                                    Windows-based system - ODBC
                                    is a Windows standard- but it
                                    can also be used from a Linux host. Upon completion of the wizard, a native JDBC
                                    (type 4) driver can be
                                    substituted if the RDBMS vendor did not supply an ODBC driver, or if JOSSO is
                                    being hosted in a
                                    system that is

            Within the "User Lookup" tab you can supply SQL queries that will be used by an Identity Provider
            to retrieve user credentials and details, as well as roles. Supplying this information is required, given
            that JOSSO is schema-agnostic and therefore requires the directives in order to adapt to an arbitrary
            schema.

            On the "Lookup" screen you can determine how user and role entries are to be
            retrieved. This is required in order to access identity data that responds to arbitrary
            schemas. This avoids forcing migrating user data to a product-specific user schema, allowing you to reuse
            existing identity silos independently of how user data is structured.

                                    The "Partner Application Id" field is a unique identifier for the JOSSO partner
                                    application that's
                                    consuming the services provided by the SP. There is a one-to-one

                                    a partner application and an SP. The SP acts as a

                                    application for negotiating with identity and access management services.

                                    Those of you who are familiar with JOSSO1 might notice that the term "Partner
                                    Application", which is employed
                                    in this first product generation, has a meaning that corresponds to the term
                                    "Service Provider", which is the term used in the
                                    SAML standard.
                                    JOSSO2 builds on legacy JOSSO1 Agents in order to realize SSO-enabling
                                    usage scenarios. JOSSO2 provides a compatibility layer, that complies with both
                                    the front and
                                    back-channel
                                    contracts of the JOSSO1 Gateway, making a JOSSO2 server instance appear as a
                                    plain old JOSSO1 Gateway.
                                    Given the partner application and SP semantic correspondence,
                                    Atricore Console enforces
                                    the use of
                                    the same identifier. As you type the SP name, the partner
                                    application identifier
                                    is automatically filled with this.

                                    for activation at design-time from the identity appliance model.
                                    As of JOSSO 2.0.2 there is no support for activating remote execution
