        The Identity Architect also controls the transformation of the identity architecture model into a fully
        executing artifact. As in the identity appliance modeler, this process is carried out in a point-and-click
        fashion.
    </p><p>
        The Identity Appliance Lifecycle Management screen offers a grid-based layout, within which tables
        represent the different states the identity appliance artifact can be in.
        Transitioning the identity appliance from one state to another state is achieved by dragging the identity
        appliance item from one table of the grid - representing the source state - and dropping it onto the table
        representing the target state.
    </p><p>

            Enabling an Identity Appliance Model to deliver the specified identity and access
            management services requires that you transform it to an executable artifact. Simply put, the executable
            artifact onto which an identity appliance is mapped is a set of JOSSO2 descriptors that are packaged as an
            OSGi bundle. JOSSO2 descriptors contribute identity and access management service definitions - such as
            SAML endpoints - to the underlying core.
        </p><p>
            In order to build an identity appliance, select the corresponding row for the target identity appliance
            within the "Saved" table of the lifecycle management grid.
        </p><p>
            The "Saved" table holds entries for the identity appliances that are candidates for
            compilation, and will ultimately be deployed and executed. Within this state, identity appliances can be
            edited and removed. To continue with the design process, click on the TBD:insert image button to
            open the identity appliance within the modeler view. To delete an identity appliance, click
            on the TBD: insert image button.
        </p><p>
            To build an identity appliance, select and drag the row for the target identity appliance item
            from the "Saved" table and drop it onto the "Staged" table of the grid. If the operation is
            successful, the target identity appliance will appear in the "Deployed" table of the lifecycle
            management grid.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Deploy_an_Identity_Appliance"/>10.2. Deploy an Identity Appliance</h2></div></div></div><p>
            Once an identity appliance has been transformed to an executable artifact it is still not available for
            execution, since the underlying execution environment is not aware of its existence. In order to
            execute an identity appliance you must first deploy it by installing the corresponding artifact onto
            the JOSSO2 execution environment.
        </p><p>
            The identity appliances candidates for deployment are shown in the "Staged" table of the lifecycle
            management grid.
        </p><p>
            The "Staged" table holds entries for the identity appliances that have been successfully compiled.
            Within this state, identity appliances can be viewed and rebuilt. To continue the design process, click
            on the TBD: insert image button to open the identity appliance within the modeler view. Then, click on the
            TBD:insert image button to rebuild the identity appliance (required in order to achieve visibility of the
            latest changes made in the editing session).
        </p><p>
            To deploy an identity appliance, select and drag the row for the target identity appliance item
            from the "Staged" table and drop it onto the "Deployed" table. The target identity appliance should appear
            in the "Deployed" table of the lifecycle management grid.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Managing_Identity_Appliance_Execution"/>10.3. Managing Identity Appliance Execution</h2></div></div></div><p>
            Once an identity appliance has been deployed - meaning that it is now hosted within the JOSSO2 execution
            environment - it is available for execution.
        </p><p>
            The "Deployed" table holds the entries for identity appliances which have been deployed and are candidates
            for execution. Within the deployed state, identity appliances can be either running or stopped. The
            "State" column shows the identity appliance's current state. Possible states include: "Deployed", "Started"
            or "Stopped". The deployed state, identified as "DEPLOYED" in the State column, represents identity
            appliances which have been deployed, but have not been started. The started state ("STARTED" in the State
            column) represents identity appliances which have been deployed and started. These identity appliance
            definitions are being realized through identity and access management services which are available
            to consumers. Finally, the stopped state ("STOPPED" in the State column) represents identity
            appliances that are no longer executing. Services corresponding to these identity appliance
            definitions are no longer up and running. Within the "Actions" columns three actions can be applied to the
            identity appliance: "Start","Stop" and "Undeploy".

                Within the "Deployed" table of the lifecycle management grid, click on the TBD: insert image button in
                the Actions column. This starts the identity appliance, transitioning it to the "Started" state.
                The target identity appliance should display as "started" in the State column.

                Within the "Deployed" table of the lifecycle management grid, click on the TBD: insert image button
                to stop an identity appliance. It will be transitioned to the "Stopped" state. The target identity
                appliance should display as "stopped" in the State column.

            Identity Appliance undeployment can be carried out from the "Deployed" table of the lifecycle
            management grid. Click on the TBD: insert image button to undeploy an identity appliance, which will
            transition it to the staged state. The target Identity Appliance will be undeployed and transitioned to the
            "Staged" state, and should appear in the "Staged" table of the lifecycle management grid.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Dispose_an_Identity_Appliance"/>10.5. Dispose an Identity Appliance</h2></div></div></div><p>
            Identity Appliance disposal can be carried out from the "Staged" table of the lifecycle
            management grid.
            This can be accomplished in two distinct ways:
            1) Click on the TBD: insert image button to dispose of an identity appliance, transitioning it to the
            "Disposed" state.
            2) Select and drag the row for the target identity appliance item from the "Staged" table and drop it onto
            the "Disposed" table.
            The target Identity Appliance will be disposed and transitioned to the "Disposed" state, and should appear
            in the "Disposed" table of the lifecycle management grid.
        </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Remove_an_Identity_Appliance"/>10.6. Remove an Identity Appliance</h2></div></div></div><p>
            An identity appliance that is no longer in use may be discarded and completely erased from the system.
            Once an identity appliance is removed, it cannot be recovered.
        </p><p>
            Disposal can be realized for appliances in either the "Saved" and "Disposed" states.
            The "Disposed" table holds the entries for the identity appliances that have been discarded, and are no
            longer available to be edited or executed. Identity Appliances within this states are candidates for
            definitive removal.
        </p><p>
            In order to dispose of an identity appliance in the "Disposed" table, select the row for the identity
            appliance and click on the TBD: insert image button within the state column. The disposed-of identity
            appliance should no longer show up within the state-specific tables of the lifecycle management grid.
        </p><p>
            In order to
            dispose of an identity appliance in the "Saved" table, select the row for the identity appliance and click
            on the TBD: insert image button within the state column. The disposed-of identity appliance should no
            longer show up within the state-specific tables of the lifecycle management grid.
