==============

Atricore Identity Bus provides a foundation for next-generation federated identity services in a secure and easy-to-manage implementation. It works with existing enterprise identity management infrastructures from a variety of vendors, right out of the box; and it easily scales and adapts to meet future identity and access management requirements.

In short, the Atricore Identity Bus enables out-of-the-box Identity Federation for organizations that need to connect disparate business applications both within and across corporate boundaries. It reduces costs substantially, creates new revenue streams and provides greater convenience, choice and control for end users. With Atricore Identity Bus you gain the ability to provide and consume identity services such as standard-based Federated Single Sign-On. But here's the best part: it requires virtually no re-engineering of the existing organization’s identity infrastructure and application installed base.

It operates between an organization’s identity infrastructure and internet-facing applications; expanding the reach and experience of the enterprise and its users by enabling seamless interoperability amongst potentially incompatible identity protocols, processes and data; transparently achieving the advantages of Federated Identity.
