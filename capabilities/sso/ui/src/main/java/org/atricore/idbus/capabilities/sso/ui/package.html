		<p>
 		For now, ALL contributions (branings) MUST be fragments to this bundle.<br>
        Wicket is really coupled with Java classpath organization, and it's very hard to plug resources
            (html, css, images, etc.) that do not correspond with the  application component structure.
            I.e. com.mypackage.MyPage.java MUST have a com.mypackage.MyPage.html template file, and the internationalization
            and variant support also rely on this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future versions may support brand contributions from non-fragment bundles, using user specific packages, etc.
